#Obtained by asking ChatGPT the following query
#Hi! Can I check if this is the correct syntax for a .yml
#file for setting up github actions to trigger on pushes to
#the master branch, on pull requestions, and for manual runs
#
#```
#on: #[push, pull_request]
#  push:
#    branches: [ main ]
#  pull_request:
#  workflow_dispatch:
#```
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]  # Runs on push to 'master' branch
  pull_request:  # Runs on any pull request
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering from GitHub Actions UI
