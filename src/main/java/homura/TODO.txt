- Reorder the commands in Homura.java, why are mark/unmark above
  todo/deadline/event???

Codestyle conventions to fix right before submitting:
- Cannot do
      if (condition) { a += 1; }
  Need to be on a separate line like
      if (condition) {
          a += 1;
      }
- Cannot do
      f(a,b)
  Need space in between like
      f(a, b)
