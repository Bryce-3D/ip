- Reorder the commands in Homura.java, why are mark/unmark above
  todo/deadline/event???
- Make `bye` and `list` proper commands rather than special cases that only
  work when the exact string "bye" or "list" is passed
- Make the Homura actually send some message on invalid inputs rather than
  just doing nothing and having the errors appear in the CLI/console thing
  in IntelliJ only


List of ???s
- Deal with the addStr(), markStr(), and unmarkStr() functions in Todo.java
  and their corresponding JavaFX versions. Is this actually good OOP design
  or bad OOP design I genuinely don't know. But it did make editing the code
  for `Level-10` (GUI) fairly straightforward.



Codestyle conventions to fix right before submitting:
- Cannot do
      if (condition) { a += 1; }
  Need to be on a separate line like
      if (condition) {
          a += 1;
      }
- Cannot do
      f(a,b)
  Need space in between like
      f(a, b)
