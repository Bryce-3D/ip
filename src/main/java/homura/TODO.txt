 TODOs
 - Fix Homura.cmdEditJavafx() to handle inputs that contains
   whitespace
 - Rearrange the cases in Homura.cmdJavafx() after BCD-extension
   (C-Update) gets merged into main/master.



Optional TODOs
- Make the Homura actually send some message on invalid inputs rather than
  do nothing and have the errors appear in the CLI/console thing in
  IntelliJ only



List of ???s
- Deal with the addStr(), markStr(), and unmarkStr() functions in Todo.java
  and their corresponding JavaFX versions. Is this actually good OOP design
  or bad OOP design I genuinely don't know. But it did make editing the code
  for `Level-10` (GUI) fairly straightforward.
