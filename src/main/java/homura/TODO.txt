List of Main Optional TODOs (JavaFX or both versions)
- Make the Homura actually send some message on invalid inputs rather than
  do nothing and have the errors appear in the CLI/console thing in
  IntelliJ only



List of Optional TODOs (CLI only)
- Handle exceptions in Homura rather than just crashing Homura
- Make `bye` and `list` proper commands rather than special cases that only
  work when the exact string "bye" or "list" is passed



List of ???s
- Deal with the addStr(), markStr(), and unmarkStr() functions in Todo.java
  and their corresponding JavaFX versions. Is this actually good OOP design
  or bad OOP design I genuinely don't know. But it did make editing the code
  for `Level-10` (GUI) fairly straightforward.
